                    Born and brought up in San Francisco, California, I am an aquarian
                    who just turned 13 years old. Just so you know, I am the crazy
                    acquarian everyone warned you about. On one side, I love exploring
                    different things. On the other side, I do have a serious goal of
                    becoming an entreprenuer.
